The complete set of code to reproduce all analyses in the associated manuscript can be generated using the 'Revision.Rmd' script. The script contains the text for the manuscript along with code chunks to produce each analysis and figure. Some additional information required to run the script (e.g., citation formats, list of citations, image files) is included in the folder. Each code block is annotated in the markdown file with explanations of what is being produced. The folder also includes scripts for older versions of the manuscript that can be ignored.
